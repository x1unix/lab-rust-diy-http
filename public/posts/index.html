    <h1>&#129408; Rustacean's paradise</h1>
    <p>
      As I code through the valley of the shadow of death<br />
      I take a look at my code and realize there's nothing left<br />
      'Cause I've been coding and testing so long<br />
      That even my compiler thinks that my code is wrong
    </p>

    <p>
      But I ain't never crossed a line that I didn't deserve<br />
      I use Rust to make my code safe and preserve<br />
      You better watch how you code and where you write<br />
      Or you and your code might be gone tonight
    </p>

    <p>
      I really hate to trip but I gotta loc<br />
      As they croak, I see myself in the Rust book<br />
      I'm the kinda coder the little coders wanna be like<br />
      On my keyboard in the night, writing code in the moonlight

      Been spending most their lives living in the Rustacean's paradise<br />
      Been spending most their lives living in the Rustacean's paradise<br />
      We code safe, we code fast, living in the Rustacean's paradise<br />
      We code traits, we code macros, living in the Rustacean's paradise
